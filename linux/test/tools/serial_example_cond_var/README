C++ example used to test libserialport and using condition variables
to synchronize threads. The example prints the time difference from
sending to receiving the message in microseconds.

The latency and cpu-load can be compared with that in serial_example
which uses 2 separate polling threads running at 1 ms intervals.

Use the supplied python file to send data on the port.

To build, create a folder, preferably build/serial_example_cond_var, cd into it
run cmake ../..
make
