C++ example used to test libserialport and verify that it works when used
in the required manner. The program inplements a simple serial class with
an internal event loop that reads data from a given port and puts it in
a thread safe queue. Another event loop polls this queue at regular
intervals and prints any data in it.

Use the supplied python file to send data on the port.

To build, create a folder, preferably build/serial_example cd into it
run cmake ../..
make
